In this project, the goal is to process a collection of regular grammars, convert them into finite automata, and perform set operations on these automata. 
Regular grammars are one of the methods for describing regular languages and can be easily converted into nondeterministic finite automata (NFA). 
Then, using standard algorithms, NFAs are transformed into equivalent deterministic finite automata (DFA). 
Finally, given the applications of regular languages, set operations such as union, intersection, and complement will be performed on the DFAs.
